**AutoGen-Gemini** is a Python framework that integrates [AutoGen](https://microsoft.github.io/autogen/) with **Google Gemini LLMs**, enabling advanced **multi-agent conversational AI** and **automated code generation**.  

It supports building intelligent **Assistant Agents**, **User Proxy Agents**, and **Group Chats** for complex workflows like:
- Automated **code writing & execution**
- **Product design** (text + multimodal)
- **Question answering** and collaborative reasoning
- **Image analysis & accessibility support**

---

## ✨ Features

- ⚡ **Gemini Integration** → Use models like `gemini-1.5-flash-latest` and other supported Gemini variants.  
- 🤖 **Multi-Agent Framework** → Agents with specialized roles (Assistant, User Proxy, Group Chat Manager).  
- 🖥️ **Automated Code Execution** → Sandbox code execution with Docker or local environment.  
- 🖼️ **Multimodal Capabilities** → Run **image analysis, object detection, accessibility pipelines**.  
- 🔌 **Modular & Extensible** → Swap in different LLMs, experiment with workflows, and extend agent behaviors. 


---

## 📊 Example Workflows

- **Code Execution:** Ask agents to generate & execute Python code.
- **Collaborative Group Chat:** Assign a "Product Manager" agent who coordinates with coding & analysis agents.
- **Multimodal Design:** Send **images** as input → Gemini LLM detects objects and describes them for accessibility.
- **Search & Analysis:** Agents retrieve information and summarize results with visualization support.
